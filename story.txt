The current paper provides an upper bound on the insecurity of the CBC MAC
and our analysis highlights the role of collisions. Preneel and van Oorschot [19]
give a corresponding attack, also exploiting collisions. Some gap remains between
our result and theirs; closing it is an interesting problem. See Section 4 for more
information. Another attack is given in [14].
Several CBC MAC variations have been suggested to get around the problem
mentioned above that the CBC MAC is only secure when strings are of some one
fixed length. One nice suggestion is to compute the (basic) CBC MAC using a first
key, and then encipher that result using a second (independent) key. Petrank and
Rackoff analyze this construction [18].
One might ask whether the security of CBCm-F as a MAC could be shown to
follow from a weaker assumption on F than that it is a PRF. Work of An and
Bellare [1] shows that it is not enough to assume that F is a MAC; they give an
example of a secure MAC F for which CBCm-F is not a secure MAC.
Cipher block chaining is not the only method of constructing a MAC. Amongst
the many proposed methods we mention XOR-MACs [6], HMAC [5], and
UMAC [9]. Some of these alternative constructions improve on the CBC MAC in
terms of speed or security bounds.

in some well-known protocols. But as the authors make clear, the CBC MAC is not
itself at fault for the indicated protocol failures; rather, it is the manner in which
the containing protocols incorrectly embed the CBC MAC. The authors go on to
correct some protocols by having them properly use the CBC MAC.
The concrete security approach makes more explicit and emphatic some features
already present in the asymptotic approach typically used in theoretical works.
With asymptotic analysis security guarantees often take the form of the success
probability of a polynomially bounded adversary being negligible (everything
measured as a function of the security parameter). The concrete security can usually
be derived by examining the proof. However, a lack of focus on getting good con-
crete security bounds has often led to reductions that are so inefficient that the
results are of no obvious use to cryptographic practice.

1.7. Discussion and Open Questions
Block ciphers like DES are in fact permutations. One open question is whether
the permutativity of the block cipher could be exploited to prove a stronger reduc-
tion than that in our main theorem. The fact that one typically outputs a number
of bits s<l seems relevant and useful in strengthening the bounds that would
otherwise be achieved.
This paper brings out the importance of modeling the fixed input and output
lengths common to the primitives of contemporary cryptographic practice. When a

family of functions, each from l bits to L bits (for some particular and fixed values.
